+Hi guys

I have changed the presentation a little bit. I didn't change too many things, just tried to highlight the important parts, added the benefits from our original document and tried to figure out the type of agile prospective and the primary objectives - see Why Agile slide, first two additional items.
Please have a look at the presentation (also on GitHub) and comment, change as you wish. ðŸ˜Š
The Mortgage Happiness title can be changed as well. ðŸ˜ƒ
We can have a short meeting if you want on Thursday, I am available almost all day.
Thank you in advance! 
Bests,
Agnes
